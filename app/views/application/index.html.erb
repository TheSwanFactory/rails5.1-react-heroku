  <p> <a href="https://medium.com/@hpux/rails-5-1-loves-javascript-a1d84d5318b">Rails 5.1</a> breaks new ground in provided integrated support for JavaScript within a Ruby on Rails application.  However, that support comes with additional complexity and changes from prior ways of managing JavaScript.

  To help you get used to the new way of doing things, this boilerplate "batteries included" application demonstrates how to build and deploy a complete modern, hybrid web application using Rails 5.1, React, and Heroku, including an ActiveAdmin console and Devise authentication.

  <p>From this page you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <%= link_to("Login", new_admin_user_session_path) %> as an Administrator</a></li>
    <li> <%= link_to("Review", admin_admin_users_path) %> ActiveAdmin Users</a></li>
    <li> <%= link_to("Logout", destroy_admin_user_session_path) %> from Devise</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that you will need a seperate Devise configuration for non-Admin users.</p>
